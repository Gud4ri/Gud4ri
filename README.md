- 🌱 I’m an average user of linuxuser of linux, mainly ubuntu derivates (Debian), currently using MX-Linux and RaspberryOS.
- 💞️ I’m in the proceess of slowly building up my IoT home based on HomeAssistant.
- My current interests (tech wise) are:
  - Networking
  - Security and privacy
  - Gaining some skills for HomeAssistant, and some basic YAML skills

I have no IT background, so I tend to use simple how-to tutorials when available.
